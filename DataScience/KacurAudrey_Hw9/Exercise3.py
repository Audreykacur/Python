# Perform Polynomial Curve Fitting on the following dataset: (-2, 3), (-1, 5), (0, 1), (1, 4), (2, 10).

# Print the coefficients and plot the graph of the polynomial function as shown in the Figure below

# Note 1: Do not use any built-in functions such as polyfit() or polyval(). You can use the functions np.matmul() and np.linalg.inv() to multiply matrices and get the inverse of a matrix, respectively

# Note 2: Your algorithm should be able to work with any dataset not just a dataset of 5 data points
