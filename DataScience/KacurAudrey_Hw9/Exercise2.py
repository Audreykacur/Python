# Based on Ex. 1, find the Least Squares Regression Line using the Matrix Algebra method.

# Verify whether you get the same regression line parameters as in Ex. 1. Plot the data points, after noise addition, along with the regression line

# Note: You can use the transpose(), np.matmul(), and np.linalg.inv() functions to get the transpose, multiply matrices, and get the inverse of a matrix, respectively
